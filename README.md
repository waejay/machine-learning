##### Why Am I Learning Machine Learning?

Throughout late high school and university, I've been tinkering around with different subsets of the world of computer science, such as full-stack web development and cross-platform game development using Java. Though interesting, I've yet to find one that really intrigues me and makes me want to learn more.

Before computer science, I thought my future laid in the hands of medical school and neuroscience. With the change to computer science, I initially thought my future with neuroscience was no more, until recently I found out how much computer science can be applied to neuroscience.

Thus, with my increasing interest with A.I. and it's potentials, I've decided to kickstart my journey in A.I. by first testing out with machine learning.

##### How Am I Learning Machine Learning?

I find that actually **doing** things helps me learn more than first **studying and learning** it, so I'm using resources such as Pluralsight's videos to allow me to hands-on deal with elementary machine learning problems.




##### Goals

- Learn the fundamentals of machine learning (primarily supervised learning)
- Apply that knowledge to a small side project (may use Kaggle for any free datasets)
- Learn the **"how do these algorithms work"** and **"where are all these strange numbers coming from"** parts of machine learning
- Apply all this knowledge to a bigger side project
